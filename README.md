## Statistics for use in press / published materials

Looking for statistics? This project does not use a mono-repo, but is split across several components. Use [Ken Fukuyama's dashboard](https://kenfdev.o6s.io/github-stats-page) to gather accurate counts on contributors, stars and forks across the [GitHub organisation](https://github.com/openfaas).

> Note: Incubator projects are not counted in these totals and are hosted under [openfaas-incubator](https://github.com/openfaas-incubator) awaiting graduation.

## FaaSFriday campaign/contest

The #FaaSFriday hashtag is a campaign for the community to share ideas, learnings and cool hacks made with OpenFaaS. For the best or more creative ideas SWAG items may be sent with a value of less than 10 USD such as a t-shirt, stickers, magnets or pin badges. If you'd like to take part you should take a photo of your screen or laptop with your entry present, this is to create a human and intentional element rather than showing a computer-generated screenshot.

See [past entries](https://twitter.com/hashtag/faasfriday?f=images&vertical=default&lang=en)
