## FaaSFriday campaign/contest

The #FaaSFriday hashtag is a campaign for the community to share ideas, learnings and cool hacks made with OpenFaaS. For the best or more creative ideas SWAG items may be sent with a value of less than 10 USD such as a t-shirt, stickers, magnets or pin badges. If you'd like to take part you should take a photo of your screen or laptop with your entry present, this is to create a human and intentional element rather than showing a computer-generated screenshot.
